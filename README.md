# applitools-hackathon
A repo to house our submission to the 2019 Applitools hackathon.

# Running the tests

Running is pretty simple:

Don't be like me. Don't forget to `npm install` first! There's a lot of necessary dependencies. Duh...amirite?

To run against V1 of the app, execute `npm run cypress:v1` in your terminal.
   
To run against V2 of the app, you guessed it, execute `npm run cypress:v2` in your terminal.

# Findings & Thoughts

Decided to do a little [live tweeting](https://twitter.com/graemeRharvey/status/1194779433376374793) of some observations while writing these tests.
After the contest closes, a blog post will follow with further thoughts over at [my personal blog](http://iteststuff.ca).
